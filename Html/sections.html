                <h1>Why use HTML</h1>
                <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used because it is the foundational language for creating and
                    structuring content on the web. It provides the basic framework that tells web browsers how to
                    display text, images, links, videos, and other elements on a webpage. With HTML, developers can
                    organize content using headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more, creating a logical structure
                    that both users and search engines can understand. It also supports semantic elements like header,
                    footer, and article, which improve accessibility and SEO by giving meaning to the content. Since
                    every website relies on HTML at its core, it is an essential tool for anyone involved in web
                    development. Without HTML, the internet as we know it would not exist, as it is the standard way to
                    create and display content online.</p>

                <h1>why use bootstrap</h1>
                <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework used by developers to build responsive and mobile-first
                    websites quickly and efficiently. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and modals, which help speed up the development
                    process. One of Bootstrap's key advantages is its responsive grid system, which allows websites to
                    automatically adjust and look good on devices of all screen sizes, from smartphones to desktops.
                    Additionally, Bootstrap ensures design consistency across pages and browsers, saving developers from
                    writing repetitive code and fixing layout issues. It also includes built-in JavaScript plugins for
                    common UI interactions like dropdowns and carousels. Overall, Bootstrap is ideal for developers who
                    want to create modern, visually appealing, and responsive web interfaces without starting from
                    scratch.</p>
