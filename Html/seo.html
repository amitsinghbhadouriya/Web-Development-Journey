                Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves a combination of programming, design, and content management to build functional and visually appealing digital experiences. Web development is typically divided into two main areas: **frontend** and **backend**. Frontend development focuses on the user interface and experience, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create layouts, styles, and interactivity. Backend development deals with the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality, often using languages like PHP, Python, Java, or Node.js. Modern web development also involves tools and frameworks such as React, Angular, or Bootstrap to streamline the process and enhance performance. As more businesses and individuals move online, web development continues to be a vital and growing field, offering endless opportunities for innovation and creativity.
